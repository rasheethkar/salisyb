Here’s an updated version of your GitHub bio with additional details and a playful tone:

### Hello there 👋

#### A Full-Stack Developer by day ☼ and a Tech Community Contributor by night ☾

Full-Stack Developer;<br>
Youtuber/Tech [SalisYB](https://www.youtube.com/@Salisyb);<br>
Open Source Enthusiast; 🐧  
Tech Speaker 🎤;  
Lifelong Learner 📚.

- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.svg`, `.psd`, `.ai`, `.ts`, `.java`
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **Tech Community**, sharing knowledge, writing code, and contributing to open-source projects.
- 💬 `ping` me about **design**, **branding**, **mobile**, **development**, **design thinking**.
- 🌱 Currently learning about **AI and machine learning**—because why not let the machines do some thinking too? 🤖
- 🚀 Passionate about **web performance** and **accessibility**—because fast and inclusive web is the future!
- 💡 Fun fact: I’m also a **gadget geek**. If it has buttons, screens, or a plug, I’m probably interested!

When I’m not coding or creating content, you’ll find me:

- 🎮 Gaming and pretending to be a pro.
- 🌟 Attending meetups and conferences—let's meet and geek out together!
- 🍕 Searching for the perfect pizza slice (recommendations welcome!).

Feel free to connect with me on [X](https://x.com/salisyb), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/saab404), or just drop me a line here on GitHub. Let's build something amazing together!
